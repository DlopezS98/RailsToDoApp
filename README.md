# Add React components & Typescript into rails application
Make sure thta you already have the webpacker package installed
```console
rails webpacker:install
```
## Installations & Setup
typescript
```console
rails webpacker:install:typescript
```
react
```console
rails webpacker:install:react
```
```console
rails generate react:install
```

Also we need to add one gem into our gemfile that's `react-rails`
```gemfile
gem 'react-rails'
```
react-rails is the official React community gem for integrating React with Rails. The main benefit of using this gem is the react_component helper method which makes it easy to pass Rails data to components.
```console
bundle install
```
Then run the react-rails generator:
```console
rails generate react:install
```
This creates the app/javascript/components/ directory for storing your React components. It also sets up configuration for mounting components and server-side rendering.
#### Note:
If you're using Rails 5, you'll also need to include the application.js file using the javascript_pack_tag in your application.html.erb layout file. If you already have a javascript_include_tag, replace it with the javascript_pack_tag.

##### _app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:_
```erb
<html>
  <head>
    <title>...</title>
    <%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
  </head>
</html>
```
Rails 6 automatically adds the javascript_pack_tag, so you don't need to add it manually unless you're using an older version of Rails.

#### Generator

The react-rails gem also provides a component generator to automatically create a basic component by passing it a component name and props (with their proptypes). Itâ€™s similar to Rails generators for creating models and scaffolds.

Go to the terminal a run the following command and now we can see the react generator command available
```console
rails generate --help
```
```console
Output:
...
React:
  react:component
  react:install
```
So, let's get started creating a component with the generator tool
```console
rails generate react:component HelloWorld greeting:string
```

##### _app/javascript/components/HelloWorld.js_
```js
import React from "react"
import PropTypes from "prop-types"
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        Greeting: {this.props.greeting}
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}

HelloWorld.propTypes = {
  greeting: PropTypes.string
};
export default HelloWorld
```
And now we can start usign the component `HelloWorld` into our views so for that we need to go to whatever view and put the component with the following sintax
```erb
<%= react_component("HelloWorld", { greeting: "Hello World!" }) %>
```
In this case we need to use a rail tag with the name `react_component` and this get 2 parameters, the first is the component name and the second are the props of our component. If you remember when we create the component we set a property named `greeting`. Also you can define many props if you want not only one.
